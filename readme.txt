Compile and Run:

run the 'compile.sh' script 

OR 

manually run these lines:
g++ -std=c++11 -c ./Sources/*.cpp
g++ -o NaiveBayes.exe *.o


- Output file is NaiveBayes.exe

- Compile time may take a few moments

- If encountering weird behavior run the clean script

- The average runtime which I experienced was ~2:55
